My research sits at the intersection of <strong style="color: #1a365d;">labor economics</strong>, 
<strong style="color: #1a365d;">causal inference</strong>, and 
<strong style="color: #1a365d;">data science</strong>. I leverage large-scale administrative 
data and modern econometric methods to answer policy-relevant questions.

## Working Papers

<div class="research-card">
  <h3>Reallocation Channel of a Minimum-Wage Shock</h3>
  <p class="collaborators">with Prof. Jungmin Lee (Seoul National University)</p>
  <p class="description">
    This paper investigates the labor reallocation dynamics following South Korea's substantial 
    minimum wage increases (2017–2019), which raised the hourly minimum by over 30% cumulatively. 
    Using the universe of Korea's employer–employee matched administrative data spanning 2015–2020 
    (over <strong>300 million observations</strong>), we examine how workers reallocate across firms, 
    industries, and regions in response to minimum wage shocks.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    Our identification strategy exploits geographic variation in exposure to the minimum wage increase, 
    employing a <strong>Difference-in-Differences</strong> design. We find that regional business cycle 
    conditions significantly moderate both the employment effects and the reallocation patterns, 
    suggesting that labor market tightness plays a crucial role in how minimum wage policies transmit 
    through the economy.

## Ongoing Projects

<div class="research-card">
  <h3>Family-Friendly Firms and the Motherhood Penalty</h3>
  <p class="collaborators">with Tammy Lee & Prof. Jungmin Lee (Seoul National University)</p>
  <p class="description">
    The motherhood penalty—the earnings and career disadvantages experienced by mothers compared 
    to childless women and men—remains a persistent feature of labor markets worldwide. This project 
    investigates whether and how firm-level family-friendly policies can mitigate these penalties.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    We examine three key dimensions of workplace flexibility: <strong>flexible work arrangements</strong>, 
    <strong>on-site childcare facilities</strong>, and <strong>remote work options</strong>. 
    Using a <strong>causal forest</strong> machine learning approach, we identify heterogeneous 
    treatment effects across different worker types, industries, and firm characteristics.
  </p>
  <p class="description">
    Our findings have direct policy implications for workplace regulations and corporate family 
    support initiatives, particularly as remote work becomes more prevalent post-pandemic.

## Research Statement

<div class="card" style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f7fafc, #edf2f7); border-left: 4px solid #4fd1c5;">
  <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; margin: 0;">
    My goal is to bridge the gap between <strong>rigorous causal inference</strong> and 
    <strong>scalable data science methods</strong>. I believe that the most impactful research 
    combines deep theoretical understanding with modern computational tools. 
    <br><br>
    As I pursue graduate studies in Data Science, I aim to develop new methodologies that make 
    causal inference more accessible and applicable to large-scale, complex datasets—ultimately 
    contributing to evidence-based policymaking and business decision-making.
