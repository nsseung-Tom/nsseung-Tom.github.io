## Working Papers

### Reallocation Channel of a Minimum-Wage Shock
*with Prof. Jungmin Lee (Seoul National University)*

We analyze labor reallocation dynamics following South Korea's minimum wage increases (2017–2019) using employer–employee matched administrative data (300M+ observations). Our DiD design exploits geographic variation in minimum wage exposure to identify how regional business cycles moderate employment and reallocation effects.
