I am a first-year M.A. student in Economics at **Seoul National University**, advised by [Prof. Jungmin Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/jungminlee). 

My research interests lie in **causal inference**, **labor economics**, and **applied microeconometrics**.

Before graduate school, I worked as a **Data Analyst → Data Product Manager** at [Toss](https://toss.im), Korea's leading fintech company.

I am seeking **Data Science M.S. programs** for Fall 2026.
