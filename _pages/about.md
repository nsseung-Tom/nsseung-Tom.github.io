I am a second-year M.A. student in Economics at **Seoul National University**, advised by [Prof. Jungmin Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/jungminlee71/home). 

My research interests lie in **causal machine learning**, **labor economics**, and **applied microeconometrics**. I am particularly interested in using large-scale administrative data to study labor market dynamics and policy effects.

Before graduate school, I worked as a **Data Analyst → Data Product Manager** at [Toss](https://toss.im/en) (Viva Republica), Korea's leading fintech company, where I applied machine learning and causal inference methods to drive product decisions as Toss expanded into a financial super-app serving **20M+ users**.

I am seeking **Data Science M.S. programs** for Fall 2026, aiming to deepen my expertise in computational methods for causal inference.

## Current Research

**Reallocation Channel of a Minimum-Wage Shock** *(with Prof. Jungmin Lee)*
> Analyzing labor reallocation following Korea's 30%+ minimum wage increase using 300M+ employer-employee matched administrative records. Employing TWFE methodology to identify how regional business cycles moderate employment and reallocation effects.

**Family-Friendly Firms and the Motherhood Penalty** *(with Tammy Lee & Prof. Jungmin Lee)*
> Investigating how workplace amenity mitigates the motherhood penalty using causal forest models for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation.
